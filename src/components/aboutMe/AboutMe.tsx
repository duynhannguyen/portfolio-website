        /* In terms of skills, I currently work with JavaScript, React, and
        related tools for front-end development. I'm also actively learning to
        become a full-stack developer in the near future. My approach is
        proactive, focusing on delivering high-quality, reusable code. I take
        initiative in self-learning and keeping up with new technologies. When I
        encounter challenges, I make an effort to find solutions independently
        before seeking help. My goal is to collaborate with a team to create
        tech products, enhance my skills, and contribute to our organization's
        success in meeting market demands. /*
